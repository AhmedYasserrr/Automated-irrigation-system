# Automated irrigation system
The world is going towards a more specialized version of everything.
Hearing about a farmer that wakes up early to water his plants is
something normal to hear. But this project purpose is to change this
normal, going towards a better, specialized, and intelligent version.
Furthermore, Using Artificial intelligence (AI) the project is solving two
important grand challenges of Egypt: Increasing the industrial and
agricultural bases of Egypt, which acts as a challenge because agriculture
is the base and the raw material of mostly everything, and Managing and
increasing the sources of clean water, which is causing a challenge
because of the increment of water demand as the population increases.
The solution is a system that measures the height, moisture, and
temperature, then integrates this data knowing the plant type to provide a
very specialized plan of water and nutrients to the plants. This way the
project is able to fulfill the design requirements which are: intelligence in
the aspect of accuracy and level of intelligence, the applicability, and the
low cost.

Moreover, to construct a prototype for this project Arduino UNO and AI
python coding are used as a microprocessor and AI department to
integrate the data, then it was trained to collect the data and set a best fit
equation for it to be able to predict the desired outputs.
Testing and observing the system had given some findings which are:
specialized irrigation and fertilizing have lower cost where it is quarter
the cost of other smart irrigation system. The system is on level one of
intelligence so it was able to preform the required tasks, and the system
was pretty accurate with accuracy of 99.1%. Moreover, the used
mechanisms in the project helped it to applicable.

In conclusion, The AI system is much better than the ordinary ways of
irrigation and fertilizing, where a specialized plan gives better cost, more
intelligence and less effort.
